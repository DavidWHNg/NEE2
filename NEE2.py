    "TENS_introduction": "This experiment aims to investigate the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on pain sensitivity. Different frequencies of TENS may be able to increase pain sensitivity by amplifying the pain signals that travel up your arm and into your brain.\n\n\
        The TENS itself is not painful, but you will feel a small sensation when it is turned on. Today we are testing the effects of monopolar and bipolar frequencies.",
    "calibration" : "Firstly, we are going to calibrate the pain intensity for the shocks you will receive in the experiment without TENS. As this is a study about pain, we want you to feel a moderate bit of pain, but nothing unbearable. \
The machine will start low, and then will gradually work up. We want to get to a level which is painful but tolerable, so roughly at a rating of around 7 out of 10, where 1 is not painful and 10 is very painful.\n\n\
After each shock you will be asked if that level was ok, and you will be given the option to either try the next level or set the current shock level for the experiment. You can always come back down if it becomes too uncomfortable!\n\n\
Please ask the experimenter if you have any questions at anytime.",
    "calibration_finish": "Thank you for completing the calibration, your maximum shock intensity has now been set.",
    "experiment" : "We can now begin the experiment. \n\n\
You will now receive a series of electrical shocks and your task is to rate the intensity of the pain caused by each shock on a rating scale. \
This rating scale ranges from NOT PAINFUL to VERY PAINFUL. \n\n\
All shocks will be signaled by a 10 second countdown. The shock will occur when an X appears, similarly as in the calibration procedure. \
On TENS trials, you will be given the choice between receiving monopolar or bipolar frequencies of TENS. Please use your mouse to select your choice. \
As you are waiting for the shock during the countdown, you will also be asked to rate how painful you expect the following shock to be. After each trial there will be a brief interval to allow you to rest between shocks. The task should take roughly 20 minutes. \n\n\
Please ask the experimenter if you have any questions now before proceeding.",
